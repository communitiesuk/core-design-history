Here are some of the things we got up to this week:

* This week has been shorter owing to the bank holiday Monday. The primary focus has been around preparing for alpha reassessment which took place today (Friday 3rd September)
* We have also carried out some Guerilla testing of the prototype for device and browser feedback
* We have also implemented some of the content changes on the back of the content review outputs. These have been updated across the whole prototype

Next week we'll:

* Following on from the assessment, we'll start building the beta backlog
* We have _Excela_ research sessions planned to understand more about the helpdesk support
* Show and tell will be taking place on Thursday at 11.30
