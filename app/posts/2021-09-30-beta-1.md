Over the last few weeks, our small design team has grown. Not one but two user researchers joined the team last week! We're also looking forward to welcoming another interaction designer and content designer next week; exciting times for team CORE.

It's not all good news, however: Fay is moving elsewhere in DLUHC. It's a well-deserved promotion for her, but we sure are going to miss her. CORE will be a fundamentally better product because of her hard work and insights.

Our Alpha reassessment took place on Friday 3 September 2021 but we had to wait a couple of weeks to hear the result. Spoiler: we passed!

In the short downtime after our Alpha assessment, I took the opportunity to rewrite the prototype.  Not only did this allow me to understand the single log submission, but means I can update things much faster in the future.

## What we tested
Our hypotheses going into testing were:

1. If we show more than one thing per page in the household characteristics section:

    * we should observe users all completing the form as easily as the previous version of the prototype

    * users who utilise assistive technology will be able to successfully navigate through the section

1. By changing the "Exit to logs" link to "Exit to task list", we will observe users building a successful mental modal of the service IA

## What we discovered

Although users told us they preferred "many things per page", we didn't see any major difference in speed of completion.

We weren't able to test with people using assistive technology this round, but some basic testing told me that too many things on a page can start to get overwhelming.

One interesting thing we heard several participants say was that they liked seeing what was coming next. Thinking about this, I think _this_ is the crux of the problem I was trying to solve by putting more than one thing on a page. I wonder if this actually _is_ a problem for users, or they're so used to the current CORE form that it's a hangover from that?

Fay asked several questions around where a user thought they were in the overall journey, and where various links and buttons would take them (before clicking). This was most revealing; it's clear that we have some more work to do to help users to understand:

* where they are in the overall service
* the labels we give things; eg, "tasklist" is what we call it

## Other work

Mohammed (our BA) did some outstanding work building a schema for all the questions, answer options and validation rules in the current CORE form.

I then converted the schema into a map, visually showing connections between questions. This allowed the team to review and build a "top 10" list of improvements. Next, we need to review this with our colleges in ADD and prioritise the work.
