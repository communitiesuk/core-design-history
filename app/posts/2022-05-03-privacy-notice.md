Our service collects personal information about tenants and buyers. Such information includes:

* ethnic group
* if a previous tenure was a hospital, prison or probation hostel
* if the household left last settled home because they were discharged from prison, a long stay hospital or other institution
* if the source of a referral was probation or a prison, youth offending team, community mental health team or health service

Tenants and buyers have the right to refuse answering any questions they are not comfortable with, and this right is outlined in the department’s privacy notice.

The service we are replacing asks data providing organisations to confirm that the privacy notice has been shown to tenants and buyers before collecting information:

In research sessions we observed that some participants from data providing organisations were unaware of this requirement. We also noticed that the people entering data are not always those responsible for collecting it.

## Ensuring that tenants and buyers are shown the privacy notice

We can make a number of changes to the offline journey to ensure the privacy notice is shown to tenants and buyers:

* ensuring the confirmation question that appears on the digital service also appears on the paper version of the log
* including the privacy notice in the same PDF download that includes the paper version of the log, increasing its visibility and encouraging data collectors to include this in the packs they put together for tenants and buyers
* updating the design of [the previous privacy notice](/privacy-notice/privacy-notice-before.pdf) so that it fits on one page, and [looks more like an official document](/privacy-notice/privacy-notice-after.pdf) by removing extraneous clip art.

## Confirming that tenant or buyer has seen the privacy notice

### When setting up a log

When thinking about which section we should ask data inputters to confirm that a tenant or buyer has seen the notice, we considered this being included in the set of questions asked when setting up a log.

However, the person setting up a log may not be the person who collected the data from the tenant or buyer. As a log can’t be started until it has been set up, this would mean other sections in a log could not be completed until this answer had been given.

### When submitting a log

Instead of asking at the start, we could get confirmation as part of a declaration section shown before submitting a log.

However, asking the question at this stage of the journey is too late. As this is the only answer required before a log can be submitted, it may encourage users to confirm that the notice had been seen, even if they are unsure.

Also, by this point, data would have been entered into the service, somewhat defeating the purpose of the question.

### Before entering information about the tenant or buyer

Knowing that different users may be responsible for completing different sections of the log, we placed the question at the beginning of the first section that asks data inputters to enter information about a household.

This way, the question is more likely to be shown to the user who originally collected the data, and is more likely to result in an accurate response.
