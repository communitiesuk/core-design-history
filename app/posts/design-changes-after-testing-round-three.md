Here are the changes we made after the user testing

## The dashboard

### User stories

1. As a Housing OfficerI want to be able to identify a log easily so that I can view and/or complete a partially filled log

### The changes

We redesigned the "Dashboard" page to

* add in more information (Postcode and Tenancy code)
* reduce visual noise
