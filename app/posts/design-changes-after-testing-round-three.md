Here are the changes we made after the user testing

## Dashboard

Jira ticket: CLDC-210

What I've been calling the dashboard (the list of logs) tested well. There was just a couple of bits of information missing.

### User story

As a Housing Officer, I want to be able to identify a log easily so that I can view and/or complete a partially filled log

### The changes

We redesigned the "Dashboard" page

* to add in more information (Postcode and Tenancy code)
* to reduce visual noise
* removed the "edit" link and made the Log reference active
* updated labels
