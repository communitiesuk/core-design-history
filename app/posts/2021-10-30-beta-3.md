Here are the changes we made after the user testing.

## About this log, upfront section

The current way to submit a CORE log asks the user to choose the type of log they are submitting from a list of seven.
Previous user research has told us that users are prone to making errors at this step and often find themselves having to cancel a log halfway through, and start a completely new one because they have chosen the wrong log type.
Consequently, we created the ‘About this log’ upfront section, which asks users for more information about this log to determine which log type they are completing. We had three main hypotheses with this round of testing:

1.	If we ask users a series of questions 'about this log' an enable them to check their answers, the chances of user error will reduce, compared to "picking a form", and the user will feel more confident about their log type selection.
2.	If we introduce a new question about whether the letting is a renewal in the upfront section, we will reduce the number of subsequent questions the user has to answer and therefore reduce burden.
3.	If we use the responses to existing questions to prefill data, we can reduce the number of subsequent questions the user has to answer.

To test these hypotheses,  we asked users to complete the new 'About this Log' section, followed by the ‘Property Information’ section, as it was most influenced by the ‘About this log’ section.

### Results

**Hypothesis 1**: This hypothesis was proved. The ‘about this log’ section tested well with users saying things like "it's easier than choosing from the list" and "I like that it's a staged process".

**Hypothesis 2**: We weren't able to prove this in this round of testing as users were confused between the terms 'renewal' and 're-let'. One user said "renewals was a bit confusing because we don't renew ... took me a while to figure it out".  We're looking at improvements to continue testing this.

**Hypothesis 3**: Hypothesis three was partially explored and tested positively but more testing on this to be done. Users were happy that "you don't need to flick through answers that's aren't relevant". A new 'inferred answer' component on the 'check your answers' page is already being worked on to help users understand what information has been pre filled.

### Other Findings

##### About this log
- Users were surprised after completing the ‘about this log’ section to see the task list, and therefore unsure how to proceed.
- Users tried to make changes to the ‘about this log’ section but could not find it in the task list.

##### Property Information Section

This section includes questions about the property that is being let (or sold), such as address, reason for vacancy, and how many times it has been previously offered.
User testing identified the following issues to address:

- Users struggled with the long list of Local Authorities when asked the Location of the property, particularly when they had selected the one they wanted, and then had to scroll all the way to the bottom of the list to select ‘save and continue’.
- ‘What is the reason for the property being vacant’ – users were expecting to see a much longer list of answer options, so did not know which answer to select.
- Users were uncertain how to answer the question ‘how many times has the property been previously offered since becoming available’, when the property is being let for the first time – “should it be zero or one?”

### User Stories

As a result of this first iteration of testing the new section, the following user stories were determined to capture the pain points.
1.	As a Housing Officer, I need to know how to complete the new CORE log form so that I understand that I cannot make changes to the ‘about this log section’.
2.	As a housing officer, I need to record the Local Authority quickly and easily so that I can move on to the next question.
3.	As a housing officer, I need to see a full list of vacancy reasons so that I can select the most appropriate option for the log I am submitting.
4.	As a housing officer, I need to understand the differences between a ‘renewal’ and a ‘re-let’ so that I can provide accurate answers to these questions.
5.	As a housing officer, I need to clarify what is required for the ‘number of times being offered for let’ question, so that I don’t get an error message or told it is an invalid log.

### The Changes

We redesigned these questions to reduce user pain points.
