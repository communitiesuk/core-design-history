Testing of the [alpha prototype (sprint 8)](http://ec2-18-168-105-184.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/sprint8/) took place in the week of 9 to 13 August 2021.

* the page doesn’t mention "CORE" – some users said it wasn't clear that they'd be "logging a CORE"
* Users mentioned it would be their manager’s responsibility to explain what CORE is, why they do it and how to do it. 
* One user mentioned it would be useful to know why they have to do CORE on this page (for new users)

### So we decided to:
