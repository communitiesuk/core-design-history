Here are two weeks worth of the teamâ€™s activities now we have moved into Beta: 

## Case level data week note 24 September 2021

- On Monday we welcomed Hazel (UR), Kimberley (UR) and Dushan (Dev) to the team
- We joined a session with DWP to talk about potential data sharing, this conversation will continue with DWP to explore options
- As a team we carried out backlog refinement and talked about the sequencing of work to be completed. We spent time looking at the end to end story map shown below to guide our planning for the next sprints, and splitting work once the whole team are onboard

- The team have started looking into the assurance processes and Gov PaaS. We intend to investigate the impact that moving from AWS to Gov PaaS would have on the beta build, starting with how data replication to CDS might work
- On Thursday we held more research sessions testing iteration to the single log submission journey - one question per page vs multiple questions per page (as this is similar to the current CORE log design)
